Question,Answer
"What is Java?","Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent."
"What are the main features of Java?","Java features include portability, object-oriented programming, automatic memory management, and strong security."
"What is JVM?","JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which allows Java programs to run on any device or operating system."
"What is the difference between JDK and JRE?","JDK (Java Development Kit) is for developing Java applications, while JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is for running them."
"What is an object in Java?","An object is an instance of a class that contains attributes and methods."
"What is inheritance in Java?","Inheritance is a mechanism where one class can inherit fields and methods from another class."
"What is polymorphism?","Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon."
"What are interfaces in Java?","An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types."
"What is a constructor?","A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects in Java."
"What are exceptions in Java?","Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions."
"What is the purpose of the 'final' keyword?","The 'final' keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and inheritance of classes."
"What are Java collections?","Java collections are data structures that store groups of objects, including lists, sets, and maps."
"What is multithreading in Java?","Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU utilization."
"What is garbage collection in Java?","Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer in use."
"What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' in Java?","'==' checks for reference equality, while '.equals()' checks for value equality."
"What are access modifiers in Java?","Access modifiers determine the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. They include public, private, protected, and default."
"What is an abstract class?","An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses."
"What are static methods in Java?","Static methods belong to the class rather than instances of the class and can be called without creating an object."
"What is method overloading?","Method overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name with different parameters."
"What is the difference between a List and a Set in Java?","A List allows duplicate elements and maintains order, while a Set does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee order."
"What is the main method in Java?","The main method is the entry point of any Java application, defined as 'public static void main(String[] args)'."
"What is a package in Java?","A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces."
"What are lambda expressions?","Lambda expressions are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows you to express instances of functional interfaces more concisely."
"What is the Stream API in Java?","The Stream API is used to process sequences of elements (like collections) in a functional style."
"What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList?","ArrayList is backed by an array and allows for fast random access, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list for fast insertions and deletions."
"What is encapsulation?","Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class."
"What is a hash map?","A HashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework that stores key-value pairs and allows for fast retrieval based on keys."
"What is a servlet?","A servlet is a Java class that handles requests and responses in a web application."
"What is JSP?","JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for developing web pages that include Java code."
"What is the purpose of the 'synchronized' keyword?","The 'synchronized' keyword is used to control access to a method or block by multiple threads."
"What are annotations in Java?","Annotations provide metadata about a program but have no direct effect on the operation of the code."
"What is the use of the 'this' keyword?","The 'this' keyword refers to the current instance of a class."
"What are design patterns?","Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design, such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns."
"What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?","Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in the method signature, while unchecked exceptions do not have this requirement."
"What is a thread in Java?","A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing, that can run concurrently with other threads."
"What is a deadlock?","A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource."
"What is the Java Development Kit (JDK)?","The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications and includes tools like the Java compiler."
"What is serialization?","Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission."
"What are enums in Java?","Enums are a special type of class that represents a group of constants."
"What is a binary search tree?","A binary search tree is a data structure that maintains sorted order and allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion."
"What is reflection in Java?","Reflection is the ability of a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime."
"What is the difference between 'throw' and 'throws'?","'throw' is used to explicitly throw an exception, while 'throws' is used in method declarations to specify which exceptions may be thrown."
"What are generics in Java?","Generics allow types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods."
"What is a facade pattern?","The facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use."
"What are unit tests in Java?","Unit tests are automated tests that verify the functionality of a small part of the code, typically a single method."
